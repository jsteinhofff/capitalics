Setup financial scenarios and see how it turns out for you over time.

> **Warning** The developer of this package is in no way an expert in financial matters. The implemented functions allow to simulate financial entities over time as good as they were undestood by a complete layman.

> This package is meant to be an inspiration of the kind "better than a spreadsheet" and not as reliable source of financial data.

> Beware of fundamental missunderstandings of financial products, one-off errors, rounding errors and anything else which can go wrong.
